## Algorithmic Thinking — Python Translations

### Short Description
A collection of my own Python translations of example code from "Algorithmic Thinking" by Daniel Zingaro (1st Edition, Polish translation). The goal is to provide clear, runnable Python versions of the algorithms for learning and experimentation.

### Features
- **Chapter-based scripts** translating examples from the book
- **Readable Python implementations** with explanatory comments
- **Ready-to-run** from the command line with Python 3.x

### Technologies
- **Python** (standalone scripts per chapter)

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+ recommended

### Setup and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/little-star45/algorithmic-thinking-python-d-zingaro-book.git
cd algorithmic-thinking-python-d-zingaro-book

# (optional) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell:
. .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

# No external dependencies are required for basic scripts
```
### Usage
Run any script directly with Python, for example:
```bash
python chapter_1.py
